# Recursive-Graphics

This assignment is based on recursive graphics where we had to draw equilateral triangles at each of the vertices of a base triangle and, depending on the depth, we had to keep drawing triangles at each vertex while halving the length of the sides each time. This is a variation of the Sierpinskiâ€™s Triangle.
